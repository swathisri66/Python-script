List

fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange"]
print(fruits)

print(fruits[1]) #

print(fruits[-1])

print(fruits[2:4])

print([:4])

print([2:])

print([-4:-2])

fruits = ["banana", "apple", "orange"]
fruits[1] = "current"
print(fruits)

loop through list 

for is used for loop

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  
check if item exist

fruits = ["apple","banana","orange"]
if "apple" in fruits:
  print("Yes, 'apple' is in the fruits list")
  
fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"] 
print(len(fruits))

fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
fruits.append("guava")
print(fruits)


fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
fruits.insert(2, "guava")
print(fruits)

fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
fruits.remove("apple")
print(fruits)

fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
fruits.pop()
print(fruits)


fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
del fruits[0]
print(fruits)

fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
del fruits

fruits =  ["apple","banana","orange"]
fruits.clear()
print(fruits)
