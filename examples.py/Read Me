Created by Guido van Rossum;  Released in 1991.

used for : web developemnt (server side),
           software development
           mathematics and system scripting.
           
works on : different platforms (windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, Etc)

python syntax = English Language

runs on = interpreter system - code is executed immediately

python treated as - procedural way, object-oriented way or functional way
procedural programming - is derived from structured programming ex: BASIC, C, FORTRAN, Java Pascal 
Object oriented programming - OOPS defines data type of a data structure  + types of operations(functions) applied to the daa structure.
functional programming - style of building the structure and elements of computer programs - that treats computation
as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data.
Process of building software by composing pure functions, avoiding shared state, mutable data and side-effects.
It is declarative rather than imperative and application state flows through pure functions.


python syntax compared to other programming languages
Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics
Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses
Python relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope; such as the scope of loops, functions and classes. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose


Python Indentation:
spaces at the beginning of a code line
identation = for readability 


Variables
ignore string literals which are not assiged to variables.
multiline comments = triple quotes
variables - containers - storing data variables

A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
